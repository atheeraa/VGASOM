 Community Detection Based on Self-Organizing Map Clustering of Graphâ€™s Embeddings
 
This is a community detection model (VGASOM), that employs a variational graph autoencoder neural network with two graph convolutional layers to encode the high-dimensional graph features into a lower-dimensional embedding, which is then clustered using self-organizing maps.
Community detection is an unsupervised learning task that has quite a number of challenges to be dealt with. Our experiments show that our approach achieves better performances than the baseline methods and shows great potential for the community detection task.
